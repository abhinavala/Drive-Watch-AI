# Drive-Watch-AI
Drive Watch AI, created by our 3-person team in 24 hours, helps police locate vehicles involved in Amber Alerts. It scans every traffic camera in the alert area and identifies matching vehicles. When a match is found, it sends the location, time, and a picture of the vehicle to the police, narrowing their search and enhancing civilian safety.
